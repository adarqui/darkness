# Commands

A very large amount of commands will live here. I aim to use them standalone and through the bot. Some commands
might seem very simple, sure. However, those are part of a progression AND as part of a polyglot framework for
pipelining various commands together from the bot. In due time..


## Simple command progressions

A simple progression for implementing commands in a language. I should fill in general characteristics of each,
or group them by characteristics such as: arrays, environment variables, loops, command line arguments, etc.

- vping
- argc
- argv
- zargs
- echo

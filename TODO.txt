configs:
- need to pull out repetitive config entries and place them into their own files, ie redis
- modularize connection/redis stuff in core/go
- ssl connections to irc
- keys for channels
- share code between listeners, etc.. eventually need an event lib
- need levels of verbose logging.. each listener, relay, etc, should be able to start via command line which accepts generic arguments & specific ones.
-- generic being verbose, redis config file, .. etc

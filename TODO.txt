configs:
- need to pull out repetitive config entries and place them into their own files, ie redis
- modularize connection/redis stuff in core/go
- ssl connections to irc
- keys for channels
- share code between listeners, etc.. eventually need an event lib
- need levels of verbose logging.. each listener, relay, etc, should be able to start via command line which accepts generic arguments & specific ones.
-- generic being verbose, redis config file, .. etc

architecture:
- should be able to start several relay bots, all connected to IRC for example. PRIVMSG's could then somehow be put through a job system so that only one bot handles one job. This way we could have 6 bots connected, and someone pastes a url, only one bot would respond with the resolved url.
- ^^ for the jobs above, we need to be able to use multiple job systems

code:
- reduce code duplication
- organize better
- get rid of config path/lib path hell

url_metadata:
- ability to ignore sites:
- https://*.gfycat.com

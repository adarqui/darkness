initial design:
- just to get this thing moving

front: (rename to relay eventually)
- connects to irc server
  - publishes connected event
  - anything received on irc connection, send to IrcRecvCh
  - anything received on IrcSendCh, send to irc connection

- connects to redis server
  - need two connections (one for pub, one for sub)
  - anything received on redis connection, send to IrcSendCh
  - anything received on IrcRecvCh, send to redis connection

- send to redis connection:
  - PUBLISH dbot:from_relay <message>

- recv from redis connection:
  - SUBSCRIBE dbot:from_tunnel

rate limiting:
- need a rate limiting channel for sending data to the irc server

front just relays data.. so, the tunnel service will have to craft PRIVMSG and NICK messages etc..
